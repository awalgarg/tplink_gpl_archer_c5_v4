The code in this project comes from a variety of sources.  Originally
starting as the KAME then WIDE dhcpv6 implementation, many companies and
individuals have contributed to what we have now.  The majority of the
contributions are under a BSD-style license, but some are under the GNU
Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later (LGPL).  Since some of the
contributions are under the LGPL, the project constitutes a derived work
and is entirely licensed under the LGPL.  The full text of the LGPL 2.1
license is available in the COPYING.LIB file in this directory.

The lists below note which license applies to each of the header and source
files in the distribution.  Note this list is here for completeness and the
entire 'dhcpv6' software distribution is licensed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License version 2.1 or later.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (David Cantrell
