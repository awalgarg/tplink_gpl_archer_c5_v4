# Additional informations for DNS setup using BIND

# If you are running a capable version of BIND and you wish to support
# secure GSS-TSIG updates, you must make the following configuration
# changes:

#
# Steps for BIND 9.8.x and 9.9.x -----------------------------------------
#

# 1. Insert following lines into the options {} section of your named.conf 
#    file:
tkey-gssapi-keytab "${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}";

#
# Common Steps for BIND 9.x.x --------------------------------------------
#

# 2. Set appropriate ownership and permissions on the ${DNS_KEYTAB} file.  
#    Note that the most distributions have BIND configured to run under a 
#    non-root user account.  For example, Fedora 9 runs BIND as the user 
#    "named" once the daemon relinquishes its rights.  Therefore, the file 
#    ${DNS_KEYTAB} must be readable by the user that BIND run as.  If BIND 
#    is running as a non-root user, the "${DNS_KEYTAB}" file must have its 
#    permissions altered to allow the daemon to read it.  Under Fedora 9, 
#    execute the following commands:
chgrp named ${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}
chmod g+r ${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}

# 3. Ensure the BIND zone file(s) that will be dynamically updated are in 
#    a directory where the BIND daemon can write.  When BIND performs 
#    dynamic updates, it not only needs to update the zone file itself but 
#    it must also create a journal (.jnl) file to track the dynamic updates 
#    as they occur.  Under Fedora 9, the /var/named directory can not be 
#    written to by the "named" user.  However, the directory /var/named/dynamic 
#    directory does provide write access.  Therefore the zone files were 
#    placed under the /var/named/dynamic directory.  The file directives in 
#    both example zone statements at the beginning of this file were changed 
#    by prepending the directory "dynamic/".

# 4. If SELinux is enabled, ensure that all files have the appropriate 
#    SELinux file contexts.  The ${DNS_KEYTAB} file must be accessible by the 
#    BIND daemon and should have a SELinux type of named_conf_t.  This can be 
#    set with the following command:
chcon -t named_conf_t ${DNS_KEYTAB_ABS}
