/**
 * ctdb - a library for accessing tdbs controlled by ctdbd
 *
 * ctdbd (clustered tdb daemon) is a daemon designed to syncronize TDB
 * databases across a cluster.  Using this library, you can communicate with
 * the daemon to access the databases, pass messages across the cluster, and
 * control the daemon itself.
 *
 * The general API is event-driven and asynchronous: you call the
 * *_send functions, supplying callbacks, then when the ctdbd file
 * descriptor is usable, call ctdb_service() to perform read from it
 * and call your callbacks, which use the *_recv functions to unpack
 * the replies from ctdbd.
 *
 * There is also a synchronous wrapper for each function for trivial
 * programs; these can be found in the section marked "Synchronous API".
