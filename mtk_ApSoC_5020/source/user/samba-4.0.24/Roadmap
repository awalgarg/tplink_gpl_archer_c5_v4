The following development objectives for future releases
are in progress:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samba-3.5.x		This release turned into maintenance mode since we
			released 3.6.

Samba-3.6.x		This is the current stable Samba 3 release intended
			for all Samba production server.

Samba-4.0		Our next release including the AD domain controller
                        feature, the file server and other functionality
                        from Samba 3.6 as well as the new SMB3 protocol.


Note that it is a given that the Samba-Team will continue to track
Windows releases, ensuring that Samba will work
well with whatever releases Redmond throws our way :-).
