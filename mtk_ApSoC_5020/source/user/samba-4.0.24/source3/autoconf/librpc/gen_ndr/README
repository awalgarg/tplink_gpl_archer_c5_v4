This is the output directory for PIDL generated files in the autoconf
build.  This is a directory that WAF does not know about, and so will
not cause problems when we make a release that must also have
source3/autogen.sh pre-run.

(Waf doesn't like files it expects to generate to already be in the
build tree).
