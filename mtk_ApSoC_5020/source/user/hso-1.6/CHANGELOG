v1.6	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Put MOD_INFO back to show if CONFIG_HSO_AUTOPM & CONFIG_HSO_DEBUG
        is set or not removed warning about disabling CONFIG_HSO_AUTOPM if
        the kernel version is too old, also fixed some sloppyness found
	by Peter Henn.

	Fixed compile bug which left reset_resume method
	defined for kernels prior to 2.6.22 where it didn't exist.
v1.5    Denis Joseph Barrow
	Updated README

	Applied Adrian Bunks hso_create_bulk_serial_device(): 
	fix of a double free patch from the linux-usb mailing list.

	Made usb_drivers reset_resume function point to
	hso_resume this fixes problems when the network
	interface is left idle for a few minutes.
	Possibly reset_resume should initialise hardware
        more but this works in the common case.

        Added check for IFF_UP in hso_resume this should
        eliminate -EINVAL (-22) errors caused from
        urb's being submitted twice once by hso_resume
        & once in hso_net_open if suspend/resume USB power saving
	mode is enabled.

        Added s setpwr.sh script so that USB power saving mode can
        be switched on or off quickly in the driver without having
        to walk through sysfs.

        Removed usb_driver_claim_interface & usb_driver_release_interface
        calls as they were deemed by Paulius Zaleckas on the
        linux usb mailing list to be unneccessary.

        Improved hso_connect.sh script to make it automatically
        detect the application port.
        Improved hso_connect.sh so that it automatically finds
        the application port.

	Removed usb_driver_claim_interface & usb_driver_release_interface
	calls as they were deemed by Paulius Zaleckas on the
	linux usb mailing list to be unneccessary.

v1.5-rc1 Denis Joseph Barrow
	Took updates upto 2.6.27-rc5,
	A new structure hso_mutex_table had to be declared statically
	& used as as hso_device mutex_lock(&serial->parent->mutex) etc
	is freed in hso_serial_open & hso_serial_close by kref_put while
	the mutex is still in use.
	This is a substantial change but should make the driver much stabler.
	Patch to stop loss of characters on the hso modems,
	this patch throttles & unthrottles the modem by
	not putting out urbs until the tty/line discipline layer
	has enough space for newly received packets.
	serial ports. This is required for firmware diagnostics
	being done at Option.

v2.6.27-rc3 Denis Joseph Barrow
	Taking code directly from 2.6.27-rc3 will be using
	the official linux kernel version as a basis for
	our future releases & porting our bugfixes onto this.

	Denis Joseph Barrow
	Fixed a problem found by a firmware engineer, the
	program basically in hso_std_serial_write_bulk_callback was being
	not sanity checking serial->tty was not NULL before calling tty_wakeup
	this resulted in a race condition where urbs  after
    	serial->tty was shut down. maybe more needs to be done here.

    	Moved kref_put in hso_serial_close as refcnt was incorrectly
    	going to zero  when serial->open_count went to zero
    	which was not consistent with hso_serial_open.
	A similar patch was posted to the linux usb mailing list.

	
1.4     Denis Joseph Barrow
        Fixed dev_kfree_skb happening too many times when hso_start_net_device
        is called from hso_resume. This manifests itself as a crash after a
        kernel message saying that the hso driver is transmitting lingering data
    
        Renamed hso driver printk macros to have a prefix HSO_ this
        was needed as the kernel also defines a macro called WARN in 2.6.27-rc1
        which hso.h also defined.
    
        Fixed a tty line stuff needed to compile for 2.6.27-rc1
    
        Made calls to hso_mux_submit_intr_urb use GFP_ATOMIC in their
        allocations like the 2.6.27-rc1 driver this prevents the kernel
        trying to sleep while in interrupt.
