OpenLDAP 2.x
------------

A sample schema file (samba.schema) has been included for use
with OpenLDAP 2.0.x.  The OIDs used in this file are owned by
the Samba team and generated from its own Enterprise number
of 7165 (as issued by IANA).

Copy the samba.schema file into your /etc/openldap/schema directory,
and add an include for it in the /etc/openldap/slapd.conf file.
Note that samba.schema relies upon the uid and uidNumber attributes
from the RFC2307 schema (i.e. nis.schema)

If you choose to import /etc/passwd, nis, or nisplus tables 
into ldap, you can use migration tools provided by PADL Software 
which are located at 

	http://www.padl.com/tools.html

It is not a requirement that a user's /etc/passwd account
is stored in LDAP for the samba.schema file to work (although
the whole point of storing smbpasswd in LDAP is to have a 
single location for user accounts, right?)

The padl tools will leave you with LDIF files which you can import
into OpenLDAP.  Before you can import them, you need to include
nis.schema and cosine.schema in your slapd.conf file.

You must restart the LDAP server for these new included schema files 
to become active.

The schema file has not been updated for the sambaSamAccount
objectclass.

smbldap-tools/
--------------

This is a collection of perl scripts (wrapped around the standard 
OpenLDAP command line tools) for managing Samba and posix accounts
in an LDAP directory.  See the README file included with the scripts
for more details.


ldapsync.pl 
-----------
For more information on these scripts, see

	http://www.mami.net/univr/tng-ldap/howto/


The ldapsync.pl script requires a small command (smbencrypt) 
for generating LanMan and NT password hashes which 
can be found at ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/contributed/
