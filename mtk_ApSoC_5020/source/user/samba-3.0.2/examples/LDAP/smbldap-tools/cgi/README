Description:
	A cgi to allow users to change their passwords via a web browser.

Installation:
	Drop this into a cgi-enabled directory on your webserver.
	Edit it and change the CONFIGURATION section to suit your environment.
	READ THE NOTES SECTION.

Notes:	This script will run as the user who runs your web server. So, to invoke the smbpasswd call, you must implement sudo.
	Example of /etc/sudoers:

	# Host alias specification
	# User alias specification
	User_Alias     PASSWD = apache
	# Cmnd alias specification
	Cmnd_Alias     PASSWD   = /usr/bin/smbpasswd
	# User privilege specification
	root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
	PASSWD  ALL= NOPASSWD: PASSWD

	This concept is probably very insecure and broken. That is why this is a 0.1 release.  :)


Feel free to drop me suggestions.   I am a perl learner so I am always open to suggestions.
