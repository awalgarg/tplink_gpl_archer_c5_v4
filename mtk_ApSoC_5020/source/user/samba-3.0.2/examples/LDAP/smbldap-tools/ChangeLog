	  objectclass to an existing posixAccount

          then ou=Groups (for example, ou=grp1,ou=Groups,...)
        . check the unicity of a group when adding/removing a user to this group
2003-10-28:
	. new option '-p' in smbldap-groupadd.pl to 'print' the gidNumber
	  of the group to STDOUT. This is needed by samba (see the man page)

2003-10-01:
        . one can now comment the two directives '$_userSmbHome' and '$_userProfile'

	  'logon path' respectively), or if you want to desable roaming profiles
	. Patch from Alexander Bergolth <leo@strike.wu-wien.ac.at>: the sambaPrimaryGroupSID
	  of a user is now set to the sambaSID of his primary group
2003-09-29:
	. added new option '$_defaultMaxPasswordAge' in smbldap_conf.pm to specifie
	  how long a password is valid

	  . the attribut sambaAcctFlags must not match the 'X' flag
	. logon script is set (for every one) to the default '_userScript' value if it is defined

	  not sambaSamAccount as it should be for samba3
	. new function read_user_entry to smbldap_tools.pm that returns
