This directory provides build tools for building a Samba based domain
appliance.

A appliance is a box that gets its username and group database from a
domain controller, and does its authentication via a domain
controller. Right now this is only supported by combining two CVS
branches of Samba, which is what the files in this directory do.

SETUP
-----

To setup an appliance do the following:

1) build and install Samba using the .spec file or Makefile in this
   directory.

2) setup winbindd by following the directions in the winbindd man
   page.

3) test winbindd, validating that domain users and groups are visible
   and that domain authentication works, both using unix tools and
   smbclient. 

for appliance printing support also do this:

4) create a print$ share with write permission for print
   administrators.

4) create the "nt printer driver" directory (by default
   /usr/local/samba/lib/ntprinters) and make it writable by print
   adminisrators.

5) populate your /etc/printcap printer database

6) add printers using the NT "add printer wizard" in the Printers
   network folder.


PACKAGING
---------

- Checkout the Samba CVS head branch into a directory call 
  samba-appliance-0.2/head

- Checkout the source subdirectory of the Samba CVS SAMBA_TNG branch
  into a directory call samba-appliance-0.2/tng

- Copy Makefile and smb.conf-appliance to samba-appliance-0.2/

- run build.sh

That should build source and binary RPMs in /usr/src/redhat/{RPMS,SRPMS}
