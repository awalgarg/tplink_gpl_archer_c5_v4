README file for stupid-ftpd

current version: 1.0beta, 2001/03/23

----------------------------------------------------------------------


* Compilation:
Look into the Makefile first !


Linux:   make
Solaris: make -f Makefile.Solaris
Windows: NOT SUPPORTED YET !!!

After successful compilation type:

Linux:   make install
Solaris: make -f Makefile.Solaris install
Windows: NOT SUPPORTED YET !!!

* Configuration (DON'T FORGET IT!!!):

The file stupid-ftpd.conf is a template for
your configuration. It is self-explaining.
And I think, it is very easy.
Copy the file somewhere and customize it.


* Running:

Type:
stupid-ftpd [-f conf-file] [-p pid-file]

Without the -f option stupid-ftpd expects the configuration
in /etc/stupid-ftpd/stupid-ftpd.conf (Linux/Unix).

With the -p option you can specify the pid-file, which you
would like to use. On default no pid-file will be used.

Have fun with it.
