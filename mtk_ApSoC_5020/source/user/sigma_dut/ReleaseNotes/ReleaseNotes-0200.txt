============================ Release 2.00 ==================================
This release is a major release since 1.0.0. The release includes the following
main differences from the previous one 1.1.0.

A. Improvements
1. Rename the file lib/wfa_ca.c to lib/wfa_cs.c that is to avoid the confusing
   names between lib/wfa_ca.c and ca/wfa_ca.c. The lib/wfa_cs.c stands for
   configuration and setting, and ca/wfa_ca.c stands for control agent.
   
2. Unified the message buffers:
   In lib/wfa_cs.c, each of functions uses the common global gCmdStr[] and 
   dutCmdResponse_t gGenericResp. 
   In dut/wfa_dut.c before using these two variables, they will be reset.

   In lib/wfa_ca_resp.c, each of functions uses gRespStr[];
   In ca/wfa_ca.c, it will be reset before using it again each time.

3. Optimize the timimg control and delay
   In the file lib/wfa_tg.c, a new function called "wfaTxSleepTime()" is 
   created. The timing and delay for packet transmit will be determined
   (assuming) by two derived variables "sleepTime" and "throttledRate". To 
   derive these variables, the following elements are used:
       a. traffic profile (file transfer, wmm/ip_tv, or mcast)
       b. frame rate
       c. the hardware platform's CPU/OS clock resolution

   Therefore, each indepedent implementation must redesign, implement and tune
   the algorithm used in this function in order to justify and control the
   transmit rate in order to achieve it is better performance.

4. Per some responses for ICMP ping, an UDP level Echo is implemented that
   allows vendors have options to use system level ping (ICMP) or use a UDP
   echo to handle "ping". This may become a default "ping" mechanism for 
   Voice Over Wi-Fi program.

5. Enhance to code to allow handle multiple Stream IDs traffic commands
   for execution and statistics reporting.
    
B. WMM Extension Beta
1. A new file lib/wfa_thr.c is created. This file contains the functions to 
   set TOS/DSCP tag and send packets in each of different threads. 

2. In dut/wfa_dut.c, the main function creates a number of threads that are used
   for WMM traffic. The receiving of WMM remains the same and with different 
   profile statistics recording.

3. In lib/wfa_tg.c  the WMM traffic thread synchronization uses
   pthread_cond_signal() to trigger the thread for performing traffic command.

C. Bug fixing
1. fix the misplacing sender socket ip address&port to receiver's.
2. close all file handles.
3. free all memories allocated.
