================================= Release 02.32 =================================


This release is an incremental release for support for the Voice - Personal
program.  This release includes the following main differences from the previous
released version 02.10 Test Engine software package.

A. Improvements to existing WFA Test Engine code

	1. Fixed bugs
           Read the revision histories in the files:

	2. Modify the throttled method in lib/wfa_tg.c. Again, please read the
           comments carefully and do your homework to adopt to your device (tuning?)

B. Voice Support
        Remove the code for end2end method to match the updated test plan. But
        the clock synchronization is still remained and optional to keep it.

C. UCC Script
   A set of new script  is implemented. Please read the other documents for
   details. These script commands support both Voice HSO and partial for 
   smart phone WMM profile. Subsequent releases will have more additions.
