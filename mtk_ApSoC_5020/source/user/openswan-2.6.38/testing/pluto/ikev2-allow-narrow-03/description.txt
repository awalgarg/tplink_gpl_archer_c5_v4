Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder.

However, this test checks to see if the responder rejects a single port
when it is configured for all ports, even if narrowing=yes.

The initiator asks for all protocols and a single ports. The responder only allows
all protocols and all ports, and despite any narrowing=yes should reject the connection.
