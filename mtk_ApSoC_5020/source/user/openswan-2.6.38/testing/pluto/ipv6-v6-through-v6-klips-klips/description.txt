Basic pluto test using IPv6 (and NETKEY):

"westnet-eastnet": 2001:db8:0:1::254/64===2001:db8:1:2::45[@west]...2001:db8:1:2::23[@east]===2001:db8:0:2::254/64

1) west ping6's from its westnet ip to the eastnet ip
2) west adds an ip6table rule to block plaintext from eastnet
3) west pings again, but pong should be dropped by rule
4) west initiates connection "westnet-eastnet-ipv6"; east responds
5) netjig sends ping packets from westnet to eastnet
