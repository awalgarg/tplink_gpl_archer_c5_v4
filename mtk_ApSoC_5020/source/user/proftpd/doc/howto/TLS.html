RFC 4217 defines FTP over SSL/TLS:
<pre>
  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4217.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4217.html</a>
</pre>
The <code>mod_tls</code> module for <code>proftpd</code> is an implementation
of RFC 4217.

<p>
RFC 2228 defines FTP Security Extensions, of which <code>mod_tls</code> is one implementation:

  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2228.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2228.html</a>
</pre>
Another such RFC 2228 implementation is the <code>mod_gss</code> module,
available from SourceForge.

<p>
Example <a href="http://www.castaglia.org/proftpd/modules/mod_tls.html"><code>mod_tls</code></a> configuration:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_tls.c&gt;
    TLSEngine on
    TLSLog /var/ftpd/tls.log
    TLSProtocol TLSv1

    # Are clients required to use FTP over TLS when talking to this server?
    TLSRequired off

    # Server's certificate
    TLSRSACertificateFile /etc/ftpd/server.cert.pem
    TLSRSACertificateKeyFile /etc/ftpd/server.key.pem

    # CA the server trusts
    TLSCACertificateFile /etc/ftpd/root.cert.pem

    # Authenticate clients that want to use FTP over TLS?
    TLSVerifyClient off

    # Allow SSL/TLS renegotiations when the client requests them, but
    # do not force the renegotations.  Some clients do not support
    # SSL/TLS renegotiations; when mod_tls forces a renegotiation, these
    # clients will close the data connection, or there will be a timeout
    # on an idle data connection.

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>

<p><a name="TLSCertificates">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How do I generate the certificate files used
by <code>mod_tls</code>?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The <code>mod_tls</code> module uses the
same certificate files as Apache's <code>mod_ssl</code>.  The
<code>mod_ssl</code> documentation explains what the files are, how they
are used, and how to generate your own:

<p><a name="TLSClients">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Where can I find a list of clients that
support FTPS?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: This page is a good FTPS resource:
<pre>
  <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html">http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html</a>

including the list of FTPS <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html#client">clients</a>.  On a related note, there have been some
reports that Debian's <code>ftp-ssl</code> client has a few bugs; using Peter
Runestig's <code>ftp-tls</code> is known to work.

<p>
Note, though, that there are known issues with some FTPS clients:

<p><a name="TLSImplicit">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How come <code>mod_tls</code> does not support
&quot;implicit&quot; FTPS (<i>i.e.</i> automatically encrypting sessions on
port 990)?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is because the Draft no longer
specifies support for such a mode.  Here is a <a href="http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html#bad">description</a> of why the alternatives
to the current mode (client-requested encryption using standard control
channel) are &quot;bad&quot;.

<p>
The long answer is covered in Eric Rescorla's excellent book, <a href="http://www.rtfm.com/sslbook/">&quot;SSL and TLS&quot;</a>.  There tend to be two
different strategies used when adding new features to a protocol: separate
ports for protocol variants, or upward negotiation.  Port 443 for HTTPS is an
example of the separate ports strategy.  The drawback to the separate ports
approach is that there is a finite number of ports available, and so this
approach does not scale well.  The benefit is that use of separate ports tends
to require smaller changes to client and server code.  Upward negotiation
is more flexible, but requires that the protocol support some sort of feature
negotiation or extension discovery, allowing clients and servers to easily
agree to negotiate &quot;upward&quot; into a secure channel.  The authors
of the FTPS Draft felt that upward negotiation was the more appropriate of
these two approaches for encrypting FTP channels.

<p><a name="TLSPerUser">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Can I require TLS on a per-user basis?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Prior to ProFTPD 1.2.10rc2, no.  The IETF
Draft specifying FTP over TLS requires that the TLS handshake occur
<i>before</i> the client sends the <code>USER</code> command.  This means that
the server does not know the name of the user that the client will be using
when the TLS session is established.  It is possible that the client's
certificate, if one is even presented, may contain information the server may
use to map that certificate to a user, but such mapping is not currently
supported by <code>mod_tls</code>.  Note that this is also the reason the
<code>TLSRequired</code> directive cannot appear in the
<code>&lt;Anonymous&gt;</code> context: anonymous logins are based on the
<code>USER</code> command.

<p>
However, in 1.2.10rc2, the <code>mod_tls</code> module was modified to allow
such per-user TLS requirements.  To do this, the <code>AllowPerUser</code>
parameter of the <code>TLSOptions</code> directive is used.  For example,
the following example <code>mod_tls</code> configuration allows non-SSL
anonymous sessions, but requires SSL/TLS for all other sessions:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_tls.c&gt;
    TLSEngine on
    TLSRSACertificateFile ...
    TLSCACertificateFile ...
    TLSOptions AllowPerUser
    TLSRequired on

    &lt;Anonymous ~ftp&gt;
      User ftp
      Group ftp
      UserAlias anonymous ftp

      RequireValidShell off

      # Note how TLSRequired is set to off here in the &lt;Anonymous&gt; context
      TLSRequired off
    &lt;/Anonymous&gt;
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
The modification also allows <code>mod_ifsession</code>-based conditions, so
that one can have settings like:
<pre>
  &lt;IfGroup trusted&gt;
    TLSRequired off
  &lt;/IfGroup&gt;
</pre>
However, there is a risk involved in using the <code>AllowPerUser</code>
option: it causes <code>mod_tls</code> not to enforce <code>TLSRequired</code>
until <i>after</i> the potentially sensitive USER and PASS commands have
been sent by the client.  This allows clients, even when
<code>TLSRequired on</code> or <code>TLSRequired ctrl</code> are in effect,
to send the USER and PASS commands <i>unencrypted</i>.  Depending on your
site's security needs, the ability to require SSL/TLS on a per-user basis
may or may not be worth the ability to require SSL/TLS for the USER and PASS
commands.

<p><a name="TLSFXP">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why does <code>mod_tls</code> break FXP
transfers?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The Draft specifying FTP over SSL explicitly
omits site-to-site transfers.  A TLS session is established between the client
and the server on the control channel and, to save on the expensive overhead of
TLS handshake, that session is reused for encrypting traffic on the data
channel.  In a site-to-site transfer, the client opens <i>two</i> control
channels, one with each server, and then arranges for those servers to open a
data channel between themselves.  However, since the servers have not
established a TLS session between themselves, that opening of the data channel
fails.

<p>
Note that the above happens only if the server requires that TLS be used on data
connections (<i>e.g.</i> <code>TLSRequired</code> is either <em>on</em> or
<em>data</em>), of if the client tells the server that the client will be
using TLS on the data connections (<i>e.g.</i> when it sends the
<code>AUTH</code> command with an argument of <code>TLS-P</code>).  Without
these conditions, site-to-site transfers can occur normally, albeit unencrypted.
Encrypted site-to-site transfers are not supported.

<p><a name="TLSv2">
<font color=red>Question</font>: How come <code>mod_tls</code> does not support
SSLv2?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: Various defects have been found in the SSLv2
protocol.  Some legacy sites need to support SSLv2 for their HTTP traffic, in
spite of its flaws.  Use of FTP over TLS is fairly new, however, and there is
not much &quot;legacy&quot; in that regard; it was felt that, as
<code>mod_tls</code> aims to provide strong cryptographic security, supporting
a known bad protocol is a Bad Idea.

<p><a name="TLSFirewall">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Using <code>mod_tls</code>, FTP sessions
through my firewall now no longer work.  What's going on?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: The short answer is that FTPS and firewalls
(and devices performing NAT) do not interact well.  The control connection
happens on a well-known port, and has no issues; it is the data connection
that poses problems for FTP-aware firewalls.  In a non-FTPS session, the
firewall can inspect the FTP server's responses on the control connection to a
client's <code>PASV</code> or <code>PORT</code> command, and thus know which
on which ports/addresses the data connection will be established.  In an FTPS
session, though, those control connection messages are encrypted (that is the
point of using FTPS, right?), and so the FTP-aware firewall cannot peek.
Hence, it cannot know which on which ports the data connection will be
established.  For firewalls that are configured to always allow a certain
range of ports (such as might be configured using the <code>PassivePorts</code>
directive), FTPS should function without issue.

<p>
Unfortunately, this is a rather intractable--and known--issue.  Earlier
versions of the Draft defining FTPS used to allow something known as
&quot;implicit&quot; FTPS, by which a client could contact a well-known port
(akin to port 443 for HTTPS; FTPS used port 990) and the server, simply
because the client contacted that certain port, would automatically encrypt
the session.  This approach has several drawbacks (the reason why it was
removed from later versions of the Draft), but it <i>did</i> allow for simple
TCP proxying.

<p><a name="TLSCCC">
To attempt to deal with the above issue, the RFC for FTP over SSL/TLS
suggests using the <code>CCC</code> FTP command (<b>C</b>lear <b>C</b>ommand <b>C</b>hannel).  The <code>CCC</code> command makes an encrypted control channel
revert back to an unencrypted channel.  This helps to solve data connection
problems in situations where network equipment (such as firewalls, routers,
NAT) peek at the control channel in order to open ports.  By sending the
<code>CCC</code> command and unecrypting the control channel, the network
equipment can once again peek at the commands (<i>i.e.</i> <code>PORT</code>
and <code>EPRT</code>) in the control channel.  Since the CCC command must
come <em>after</em> the client has logged in, the <code>USER</code> and
<code>PASS</code> commands on the control channel will still be protected by
SSL/TLS.

<p>
Note that in order to configure the <code>mod_tls</code> module to allow use of
the <code>CCC</code> command by clients, the following must appear in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>:
<pre>
  TLSRequired auth+data
</pre>
See the <a href="../contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSRequired"><code>TLSRequired</code></a> description for more details.

<p><a name="TLSSlow">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Sometimes my encrypted transfers are slow.
Is there a way to speed them up?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:  There have been reports that increasing the
tunable buffer size (using the <code>--enable-buffer-size</code> option
of the <code>configure</code> script) to 8192 increases transfer speeds, most
notably on very high speed networks.  Increasing the buffer size does not
appear to affect normal FTP transfers (in fact, it may benefit them as well,
depending on the client).

<p><a name="TLSDataProtection">
<font color=red>Question</font>: I can login using FTPS, but I cannot see
any directories.  Why not?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: You have most likely configured
<code>mod_tls</code> to require SSL/TLS protection for data transfers as
well as control commands, by using:
<pre>
  TLSRequired on
</pre>
However, if your FTPS client does not expect to handle encrypted data
transfers (and directory listings count as data transfers, as they are
sent over a data channel), you may see your client appear to hang, waiting
for data it can read.  Make sure your client is prepared to handle the
security requirements you have configured on the server.

<p>
You may also see the following appear in the <code>TLSLog</code> on occasion:
<pre>
  PROT: unwilling to accept security parameter (C), declining
</pre>
The <code>PROT</code> FTP command is used to set the protection level to
be used for data transfers.  Some clients send a <code>PROT</code> command
with a security parameter of <code>C</code>, meaning &quot;Clear&quot;,
which effectively tells the server not to protect data transfers.  The
<code>mod_tls</code> module will refuse the <code>C</code> security parameter
if, like above, there is &quot;TLSRequired on&quot in your
<code>proftpd.conf</code>.  This case also indicates a disagreement between
the client's security expectations and the security policy you have configured
on the server.

<p><a name="TLSBuildErrors">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why would I see the following errors while attempting to build <code>proftpd</code> with <code>mod_tls</code>?

  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
  make: *** [proftpd] Error 1
</pre>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:
Add <code>-ldl</code> to your configure command, for example:
<pre>
  make clean
  ./configure LDFLAGS=-ldl ...
  make
</pre>
This tells the <code>proftpd</code> build system to add <code>libdl</code>,
an OS-specific library for handling dynamically loaded code, to the list
of libraries used when linking <code>proftpd</code>.  On some systems, the
functions in the <code>libdl</code> library are part of <code>libc</code>, and
are not in a separate library.

<p>
I suspect that the reason this build option may be necessary is that OpenSSL
0.9.8 contained changes regarding how OpenSSL loads "engines", software modules
that talk to hardware devices that can do specialized cryptographic operations.
These changes involve being able to dynamically load the "engine" software
modules.

<p><a name="TLSNoSharedCipher">
<font color=red>Question</font>: Why would I see a &quot;no shared cipher&quot; error in the TLSLog when attempting to connect with my FTPS client?<br>
<pre>
  Jan 10 17:15:18 mod_tls/2.1.1[2212]: TLS/TLS-C requested, starting TLS handshake
  Jan 10 17:15:18 mod_tls/2.1.1[2212]: unable to accept TLS connection:
    (1) error:1408A0C1:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:no shared cipher
  Jan 10 17:15:18 mod_tls/2.1.1[2212]: TLS/TLS-C negotiation failed on control channel
</pre>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:
There are two reasons this might happen.

<p>
The first is that there is indeed no ciphersuite in common between
<code>mod_tls</code> and your FTPS client.  The SSL/TLS ciphersuites used by
<code>mod_tls</code> are configured using the <code>TLSCipherSuite</code>
directive.  If you have a complex or restrictive <code>TLSCipherSuite</code>
configured, that could be the culprit.  Try relaxing (or removing outright)
your <code>TLSCipherSuite</code>, or try to configure your FTPS client to use
the same SSL/TLS ciphersuites.

<p>
Another possibility is a misconfiguration.  If your
<code>TLSCACertificateFile</code> and <code>TLSRSACertificateFile</code>
directives are in the &quot;server config&quot; context of the
<code>proftpd.conf</code> file, <i>and</i> you have
<code>&gt;VirtualHost&lt;</code> sections in your <code>proftpd.conf</code>,
then you might see the &quot;no shared cipher&quot; error.  The easiest
thing is to move those <code>TLSCACertificateFile</code> and
<code>TLSRSACertificateFile</code> directives into a <code>&gt;Global&lt;</code>
section in your <code>proftpd.conf</code>, so that they apply to all
vhosts configured.  The virtual hosting <a href="Vhost.html">howto</a>
describes this in more detail.

<p><a name="TLSRenegotiations">
<font color=red>Question</font>: My FTPS client sometimes times out after uploading/downloading more than 1 GB of data.  When I turn off SSL/TLS, the upload/download works. Why?<br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>:
The culprit behind this is most likely SSL/TLS renegotiations.  By default,
<code>mod_tls</code> uses SSL/TLS renegotiations to periodically update the
session key which protects the data being transferred; see the
<a href="../contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSRenegotiate"><code>TLSRenegotiate</code></a> documentation for more details, particularly the time-based <i>and</i>
bytes-based limits at which renegotations are forced.

<p>
Some FTPS clients, however, do not support server-initiated SSL/TLS
renegotations.  When the server does try to force a renegotiation, the client
fails that new handshake, cannot upload/download any more data over the
protected channel, and the transfer will eventually time out.  Alternatively,
the transfer could terminate strangely in the middle of the upload/download.
<b>Note</b>, however, that not <i>all</i> transfer issues will be caused
by SSL/TLS renegotiations.  Bugs in firewalls and routers can also cause
these symptoms.

<p>
Should you suspect that you are having issues with your FTPS client because
of SSL/TLS renegotiations, you can configure <code>mod_tls</code> to
accept renegotiations if the client requests one, but not to otherwise force
them:
<pre>
  TLSRenegotiate required off
</pre>

<p><a name="TLSNoCertRequest">
<font color=red>Question</font>: My FTPS client has trouble connecting to <code>proftpd</code> using SSL/TLS, with the following error appearing in the <code>TLSLog</code>:
<pre>
  Sep 17 11:03:46 mod_tls/2.1.2[9628]: TLS/TLS-C requested, starting TLS handshake
  Sep 17 11:03:46 mod_tls/2.1.2[9628]: unable to accept TLS connection: received EOF that violates protocol
  Sep 17 11:03:46 mod_tls/2.1.2[9628]: TLS/TLS-C negotiation failed on control channel
</pre>
Is this a bug in <code>mod_tls</code>, in the client, or something else?<br><br>
<font color=blue>Answer</font>: There might be several different causes for
this error.  It could be a bug in the OpenSSL library, in <code>mod_tls</code>,
in the FTPS client, or it could be a transient network issue.

<p>
Now, one possible thing to try is to use the following in your <code>proftpd.conf</code> file:
<pre>
  TLSOptions NoCertRequest
</pre>
This option tells the OpenSSL library to <b>not</b> include a message requesting
the client's certificate in the SSL/TLS handshake messages.  Some older
SSL implementations seem to have trouble with this certificate request message,
and react badly.  This includes some Windows FTP clients, as well as some
FTP clients for the Mac.

<p>
One user tried using both the <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> and the <a href="http://www.fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a> applications for
the Mac; both state that they can handle FTP over SSL/TLS.  Using both of
these applications, the user saw the above error.  The user, when using
Transmit, saw the following error message appear from the client:
<pre>
  Server said:
  AUTH TLS successful
  error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0)
</pre>
And when using Fetch, the error message displayed by that client was:
<pre> 
  SSL Error -9844
  Server responded: "AUTH TLS successful"
</pre>
In <b>both</b> causes, using "TLSOptions NoCertRequest" appeared to make
those clients happy.
