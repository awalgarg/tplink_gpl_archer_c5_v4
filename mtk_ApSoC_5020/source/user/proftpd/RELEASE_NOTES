                    1.3.1 Release Notes
                  ------------------------

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the
1.3.1 release cycle, from the 1.3.1rc1 release to the 1.3.1-stable release.
More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS and ChangeLog
files.

1.3.1 (stable)
---------------

  + Bugfixes:

    Fixed compilation error in mod_sql_mysql.

    Fixed handling of the --ipv4 and --ipv6 command-line options.

    Fixed "directory not accessible" errors when using the mod_facl module

    Improvements to the RPM spec file, and updated the PAM configuration
    installed by the RPM spec.

1.3.1rc3
---------

  + Bugfixes:

    Fixed segfault which can occur if NLST is used twice, the first time
    on a path which does not exist.

    Fixed reporting of addresses via EPSV for IPv6 addresses.

    Fixes occurrences of "ai_family not supported" for inetd-run
    proftpd daemons.

    DisplayLogin, DisplayQuit, and DisplayTransferFiles files now work
    regardless of whether the session process is chrooted.

  + New documentation:

    doc/howto/Timestamps.html
    doc/howto/Tracing.html

1.3.1rc2
---------

  + Bugfixes:

    Fixed mod_sql's mishandling of WHERE clauses.  This was causing
    problems with mod_sql-based authentication, and errors containing
    "{UNKNOWN TAG}" to appear in the SQLLogFile.

    Under certain conditions, use of shared modules could lead to segfaults.
    This usually happened after proftpd had been restarted (using SIGHUP)
    a couple of times.

    Symlinks in a skeleton directory were not being properly copied when
    the CreateHome directive was used.

  + New configuration directives:

    RadiusNASIdentifier

      By default, the mod_radius module sends the string "ftp" as the
      NAS-Identifier attribute in RADIUS packets.  This string is now
      configurable via the RadiusNASIdentifier directive.

1.3.1rc1
---------
  + Command changes:

      MDTM now always returns times in GTM, regardless of TimesGMT setting

  + New configuration directives:

      DisplayChdir

        This directive replaces the old DisplayFirstChdir directive,
        and will cause the configured file to be displayed whenever the
        client changes into the directory in question, rather than only
        once.

        To get the previous behavior, use:

          DisplayChdir path true

        which says to display the given path only once.

      DisplayFileTransfer

        Whenever a file has been successfully uploaded/downloaded, the
        configured file will be displayed to the client.

      FACLEngine

        The mod_facl module is used to support POSIX ACLs, and is built
        into proftpd if the --enable-facl configure option is used.
        To disable POSIX ACL support at runtime, use this new directive
        in your proftpd.conf:

          <IfModule mod_facl.c>
            FACLEngine off
          </IfModule>

      QuotaOptions

        The mod_quotatab module supports a new QuotaOptions directive.
        This directive currently supports one option: "ScanOnLogin".
        With this option enabled, mod_quotatab will perform a
        (possibly) intensive scan of the directory into which the client
        is logged, and update the tally for the user accordingly.

      SQLOptions

        The mod_sql module supports a new SQLOptions directive.  This
        directive currently supports two options: "noDisconnectOnError"
        and "useNormalizedGroupSchema".

        The "noDisconnectOnError" option tells mod_sql not to automatically
        disconnect the client's session whenever there is a database
        error.

        The "useNormalizedGroupSchema" option tells mod_sql to use a
        slightly different SQL statement when retrieving information
        from a group information table (see SQLGroupInfo).  See:

          doc/contrib/mod_sql.html#SQLOptions

        for details.

      TLSCryptoDevice

        With this directive, the mod_tls module can now make use of
        OpenSSL's support for cryptographic accelerator cards, known
        as "engines" in the OpenSSL documentation.

      TLSPassPhraseProvider

        The mod_tls module now has support for obtaining passphrases
        for certificate keys via an external program.  This directive
        is similiar to the Apache mod_ssl module's SSLPassPhraseDialog
        directive (but not *quite* the same; see the documentation for
        details.)

      Trace, TraceLog

        The Trace functionality is intended to be a more focused
        type of debug logging, where components can log, at various
        log levels, to a log "channel".  Log channels can have their
        verbosity managed independently; all log channels write to
        the same TraceLog.  Use of trace logging, while small now,
        will grow in future releases.

        To get an idea of what the trace logging might look like,
        you can add the following to your proftpd.conf:

          Trace ALL:9
          TraceLog /path/to/ftpd/trace.log

      UseIPv6

        To disable IPv6 support in a running proftpd, you can place:

          UseIPv6 on|off

        at the top of your proftpd.conf.

        Alternatively, there are command-line options for controlling
        this:

          -4, --ipv4     Support IPv4 functionality only
          -6, --ipv6     Support IPv6 functionality

        Instead of using the UseIPv6 configuration directive, you can
        invoke proftpd using the -4 command-line option:

          proftpd -4 ...

      UseLastlog

        Enables use of logging to lastlog files.

      UseUTF8

        Disables use of UTF8 encoding for file paths.  If the --enable-nls
        configure option is used, then UTF8 encoding support will be
        enabled by default.

  + Enhanced configuration directives:

      CreateHome uid gid

        The CreateHome directive now allows creation of non-root-owned
        parent directories in the path leading up the created home directory.
        The optional 'uid' and 'gid' parameters for this directive can be
        used to set the UID and GID of the owner for the parent directories.

        For more details, read:

          doc/howto/CreateHome.html

      LogFormat %S, %{version}

        The LogFormat directive now handles two new variables, %S and
        %{version}.

        The %S variable can used to log the response message, the human
        readable message which accompanies the response code, sent to
        clients in response to FTP commands.

        The %{version} variable logs the version of ProFTPD; it is mainly
        useful for logs collated from multiple proftpd instances which
        may be running different versions.

      SQLConnectInfo MySQL Unix domain socket

        The SQLConnectInfo directive can now handle an optional path to
        a Unix domain socket for MySQL database connections.

      SQLNamedQuery

        SQL statements configured using mod_sql's SQLNamedQuery directive
        can now use environment variables using "%{env:VAR}".  The value
        of the environment variable VAR will be substituted into the
        SQL statement.

      SQLGroupWhereClause, SQLUserWhereClause

        These directives, from mod_sql, can now use the same variables as
        supported by SQLNamedQuery directives, with the exception of "%{n}"
        numeric references.

      TLSRequired auth, auth+data

        The TLSRequired directive for mod_tls supports two new settings:
        'auth' and 'auth+data'.  These settings are documented in:

          doc/contrib/mod_tls.html#TLSRequired

  + New configure options:

      --enable-devel=stacktrace

        This configure option enables logging of the call stack trace
        whenever a SIGSEGV signal is received.  Very very useful for
        tracking down the cause of a segfault.

      --enable-nls

        This configure option enables handling of translated message
        catalogs for response messages, and also enables handling of
        UTF8 paths in client commands.

      --with-lastlog[=PATH]

        A lastlog is a binary type of log file, similar to utmp/wtmp.
        This compile option enables logging to the lastlog file.
 
  + New modules:

      mod_ban

        This module supports dynamic "blacklists" based on configurable
        rules.  See the documentation for more details:

          doc/contrib/mod_ban.html

      mod_lang

        This module is part of the internationalization/RFC2640 support,
        handling the LANG command.  More information can be found at:

          doc/modules/mod_lang.html

      mod_quotatab_radius

        This new module provides support for obtaining quota limits via
        RADIUS, and is part of the mod_quotatab family.  More details
        are available in:

          doc/contrib/mod_quotatab_radius.html

      mod_wrap2, mod_wrap2_file, mod_wrap2_sql

        These modules are intended to replace mod_wrap, and provides ways
        of maintaining tcpwrapper-like rules in both existing files *and*
        SQL tables.  The documentation for these are:

          doc/contrib/mod_wrap2.html
          doc/contrib/mod_wrap2_file.html
          doc/contrib/mod_wrap2_sql.html

  + New documentation:

      doc/howto/CreateHome.html

  + Module enhancements:

     mod_ctrls_admin

       New 'scoreboard' control action, for scrubbing the ScoreboardFile
       on demand.

  + Deprecated configuration directives:

      DisplayFirstChdir

        This directive is deprecated in favor the new DisplayChdir
        directive.  Support for this will be removed in future
        releases.

      HiddenStor

        Use the HiddenStores instead; support for the HiddenStor directive
        will be removed in future releases.

      SQLHomedirOnDemand

        The CreateHome directive would be used instead.  For more
        information on CreateHome, see:

          doc/howto/CreateHome.html
