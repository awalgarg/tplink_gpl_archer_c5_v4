*5.5*

    snmplib:
      - Added GCC format checking attributes to the debug functions.
      - Added a alias transport for mapping complex transport strings to
	simple name definitions
      - Change CONTAINER_INSERT to not do partial inserts in containers
	with multiple indices when one insert fails.
      - Change snmp_sess_add_ex to consistently close and delete the
	transport argument on failure, earlier the liveness of the
	transport argument was undecided.
      - Change the type of the oid arguments from oid* to const oid*.
	Update mib2c to take advantage of the change.
      - Convert generic source arguments from const u_char* to const void*
	for snmp_pdu_add_variable, snmp_varlist_add_variable,
	snmp_set_var_value, snmp_set_var_typed_value and memdup.
      - Corrected registering of multiple premib config handlers so that
	all of them get registered as premib handlers as opposed to the
	earlier behaviour where they always got registered as normal config
	items.
      - Deallocate the _mibindexes cache in shutdown_mib to make for a
	cleaner exit of the library
      - Deallocate the confmibs and confmibdirs variables in shutdown_mib
	to make for a cleaner exit of the library
      - Do not leak memory whenever an udp address is formatted.
      - Do not try to look up empty strings as hostnames for IPv6
	Additinally, print what string filed to resolve using getaddrinfo
	for IPv6
      - Implemented RFC5343 contextEngineID probing. This allows for
	probing of the contextEngineID without requiring the USM security
	model. - implemented entirely within the library for both clients
	and servers.
      - Introduce printf-like versions of config_perror and config_pwarn
	(netsnmp_config_error and netsnmp_config_warn). Replace many
	instances of { tmpbuf[...]; sprintf(tmpbuf, ...);
	config_p*(tmpbuf); } with netsnmp_config_*(...);
      - Make use of the C99 predefined variable __func__ in addition to the
	GCC symbol __FUNCTION__ to get the name of the current function
      - Read the config parameters defTarget and defDomain from snmp.conf
	as well as from <application>.conf
      - Remove the support for generation of statistics of how often a
	certain debug log level is triggered.
      - Remove the variable debug_num_excluded. There is nothing that sets
	debug_num_excluded and there is no way to for it to affect the
	result of any function.
      - Use the default_target argument if it is non-NULL, not if it is
	NULL.
      - [BUG 1600171]: Support longer community strings in VACM config.
	Patch provided by Robert Wilcox
      - [BUG 1619827]: link against needed external libraries at library
	link time (where they are referenced), rather than application link
	time. Already covers most of libnetsnmpmibs' external dependencies.
	Fixes build issues on some platforms (e.g. building with shared
	libraries on AIX). Tested on different versions of Linux, Solaris,
	HP-UX, AIX and IRIX.
      - [BUG 1619827]: link net-snmp libraries and binaries against the
	net-snmp libraries they really depend on - reflect library
	interdependencies at link time - fix dependencies on libcrypto,
	libpkcs11 and libkstat - install libraries in correct order
	(important for libtool relinking)
      - [BUG 1660061]: Validate engineIDs more strictly.
      - [BUG 1795840]: Signed 32-bit truncation logged as debug message

    snmplib, snmpd:
      - [BUG 2001124]: Allow embedded NUL characters in usmUserPublic

    snmpapi:
      - Do not use getservbyname to find default port numbers, just
	hardcode them and let the user override them if needed.

    snmpd:
      - 0 ipNetToPhysicalLastUpdated OID implemented   The value is
	estimated with every cache reload, which is once in 60 seconds by
	default. That means the value reported by snmpd may differ from
	reality by one minute. If anybody needs better precision, the cache
	timeout can be configured by setting
	NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsCacheTimeout.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35 to appropriate
	value by snmpset.
      - Add missing function declarations.
      - Add missing include files.
      - Added support for a user provided length variable and C string
	values to the watcher helper.
      - Applying patch from Magnus Fromreide to fix the getbulk issue
	reported by Oscar Mira-Sanchez
      - As the null handler is perfectly capable of handling GET_BULK
	requests it is now marked as such in the registration.
      - Correct the dependency information for host/hr_storage
      - Enable automatic reregistering of sysORTable entries from AgentX
	subagents. Add the sysORTable interface to the include directory.
	Rewrite the sysORTable module to use the table_container handler.
      - Enforce the lower limit on scalar_groups This fixes the case of
	getnext icmp.0 returning icmp.0.0 instead of the expected
	icmpInMsgs.0
      - FEATURES: 1019429: Set supplementary groups via initgroups(3)
      - Get the table_container data from the right handler when
	unregistering a table_container.
      - Move sysORLastChange from mibII/system_mib to mibII/sysORTable in
	order to keep the data and the use together.
      - Register CPU/memory hardware modules with nsCacheTable. Allows
	monitoring frequency to be configured dynamically.
      - Reimplementation of snmpMPDStats.
      - Reimplementation of usmStats.
      - Remove unused variables.
      - The majority of the dependencies on util_funcs is for the header_*
	functions. Factor out the header_* functions and adjust the
	requirements.
      - The scalar helper that was called from the scalar_group helper did
	nothing save adding a trailing 0 to the argument. Remove the use of
	the scalar helper from the scalar_group and add the trailing 0 in
	the scalar_group helper.
      - Unify all snmpd statistic variables and make the handlers instances
	of a common handler.
      - Use the worker helpers from the register_*_instance helpers and
	schedule the instance helpers for removal in 5.6
      - [BUG 1046327]: Reset "includeAllDisks" flag when reloading.

	sufficient?
      - patch from Tushar Gohad to clean up notification registerations
	during disman event mib cleanup processing.
      - [BUG 112694]: Patch from Bill Fenner: don't open (and clobber) an
	agentx socket if the other transports fail to open

    snmpd, apps:
      - Parser of -LS command line argument now accepts both '-LS <level>
	<facility>' and '-LS <level><facility>'. Before patch #1806336 the
	first syntax was the only one supported. The patch changed the
	syntax to the second one, causing incompatibilities in stable
	branches. We now support both of them.

    snmpd, snmplib:
      - Remove the inline declarations for functions that lack an inline
	definition.
      - Replace the invalid %08p format specifier with the correct %8p.
      - Use NULL instead of 0 for NULL pointers. Use casted 0's instead of
	0 for NULL function pointers.
      - fixups for prototype [(void) replacing ()].

    snmpd, snmplib, mib2c:
      - Move the definition of inline functions so that the compiler sees
	them before it sees uses of them.

    snmpd, snmpnetstat, snmptrapd, snmpdelta:
      - Use NULL instead of 0 for NULL pointers. Use casted 0's instead of
	0 for NULL function pointers.

    snmpnetstat:
      - [PATCH 2564538]: to support GETBULK in v2c+ snmp versions

      - FEATURE: 1159947: Allow control of traphandle data format
      - FEATURE: 741375: Extend -F flag to cover syslog/execute format
	strings.
      - Withdraw deprecated options. (Three and a half years' warning
	should be enough for anyone!)
      - [BUG 1638225]: Fix interpretation of transport address data. (Keep
	this consistent with snmpUDPDomain.c) This does not feel the right
	way to handle this!
      - [BUG 1955227]: Memory leak for embedded Perl on x86_64
      - [PATCH 1746992]: Improve snmptrapd access-control error messages.

	the agent's engineID

    snmpwalk:
      - [PATCH 1723620]: Specify an explicit end-point for the walk. An
	alternative (more flexible) approach to the proposed patch, but one
	that provides equivalent functionality. Also addresses Feature
	Request #722784.

    aix:
      - Add support for AIX 6.x

    apps:
      - [BUG 1964136]: Drop NULL type from snmpset usage message.
      - [PATCH 1529523]: Close SNMP session on failure.

    build:
      - Assume that the target platform supports memcpy, memmove, memset,
	strchr and strrchr.
      - Do not require use of --with-endianness when cross-compiling.
      - Improved RPM spec files, for better consistency with
	vendor-provided packages. Provided by Jan Safranek
      - Link libdl against libnetsnmpmibs instead of snmpd. Fixes the build
	on (some) Solaris systems.

	Fedora 7
      - add configure check for hasmntopt to fix the build on systems that
	lack it
      - add workaround for AC_FUNC_GETMNTENT() bug in autoconf 2.60b and
	2.61 (see Debian bugs #403243, #403079)
      - disable-as-needed now allows to revert to the former default
	behaviour of linking libperl to applications rather than Net-SNMP
	Libraries (in case of any problems)
      - library layering improvements: build libraries in the correct order
	(libnetsnmpagent before libnetsnmphelpers before libnetsnmpmibs)
      - make use of AC_PROG_SED/AC_PROG_GREP and / to further minimize
	sed/grep problems
      - only enable mibII/ipv6 through --enable-ipv6 on systems it builds
	properly on (Linux and *BSD)
      - patch from apple to simplify makefile target references in some

	libtool temporary files.
      - work around libnetsnmpagent/libnetsnmphelpers dependency issues
	when linking snmptrapd
      - yet another fix to address build issues with ethtool (on RH9).
	Patch provided by Magnus Fromreide.
      - Upgrade libtool version to 2.2.6 in order to work around a buglet
	that made autoreconf -vif erase config.sub and config.guess.
      - [PATCH 2184039]: misc fixes for freeing memory during error
	conditions.

    building:
      - Add a variation of AC_SEARCH_LIBS where the result variable is
	settable.
      - At least Sun C 5.7 fails if one tries to access __func__ in a
	extern inline function, so test for that case.
      - Be a lot more strict on the values that are acceptable for
	--with-persistent-mask (only allow three octal digits)
      - Change the macro for --with-features-of from AC_ARG_ENABLE to
	AC_ARG_WITH in order to make the option be --with-features-of.
      - Check for support of static inline functions instead of nested
	static inline functions when determining if static inline functions
	work
      - Check that the temp-file-pattern ends in 6 X's as mkstemp and
	mktemp require that.
      - Disable inlining on solaris as there are some linking errors that
	show up if the inline support is left enabled.
      - Disable tests if the agent is built without the mib module they
	depend on.
      - Fix compilation on IRIX
      - Remove explicit definitions of items that autoheader also defines
      - Remove more net-snmp specials in the configure scripts to ease
	maintenance. Also change recently added
	STRUCT_SOCKADDR_STORAGE_HAS_SS_FAMILY.
      - Retire the config_old/new_require feature and replace it with
	config_version_require that compares version numbers to achieve a
	similar thing
      - Use AC_CHECK_MEMBERS instead of AC_CHECK_STRUCT_FOR when checking
	for struct ipstat members in order to make configure.in smaller
      - Use AC_CHECK_TYPES instead of a homegrown alternative to check for
	types
      - Use config_error instead of config_require of a bogus file/#error
	to generate error messages at configure time.
      - We are currently using the practice of adding a mirroring
	AC_ARG_WITH/ENABLE to each AC_ARG_ENABLE/WITH. This patch adds
	NETSNMP_ARG_WITH/ENABLE macros that automatically adds the mirror
	variable and then converts the configure machinery to use them.
