 These are all examples of how you can use the Vstr library, they are often
centered around IO (as that's the main design of the library) but some show
features like custom formatters.
 They all require a POSIX like environment ... although the library should
happily work on win32 etc.

 All code in this dir. is also under the LGPL, not the GPL.

        Allow none 
	Redirect for non-canonical URLs (Ie. %61 used) -- like %2e/%2f fixup
	mime_types speed, by having explicit filename/ext matches

	 fd cache
	 stat cache
	conf
         allow setting socket options?
         Location: + custom error files?
