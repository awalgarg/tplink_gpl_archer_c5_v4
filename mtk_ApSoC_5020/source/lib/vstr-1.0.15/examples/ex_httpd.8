.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBjhttpd\fR is a server daemon that services HTTP requests\&.

.PP
A full explanation of the capabilities requires reading the \fBjhttpd\&.conf\fR(5) manual page, however there are simple configurations that just map HTTP requests to filenames which can be used without any configuration files\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-daemon
If specified, this parameter causes the server to operate as a daemon\&. That is, it detaches itself and runs in the background, fielding requests on the appropriate port\&. Operating the server as a daemon is the normal way of running \fBjhttpd\fR for long term use\&.

.TP
\-\-version
\-V
Prints the program version number\&.

.TP
\-\-configuration-file <configuration file>
\-\-config-file <configuration file>
\-C <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server\-specific information\&. See \fIjhttpd\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The normal configuration file name is /etc/jhttpd/jhttpd\&.conf and then all the \&.conf files in /etc/jhttpd/conf\&.d\&.

.TP
\-d
This increases the \fIdebuglevel\fR from 0 to 3 (by specifying the option multiple times)\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.

The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, no debug information will be logged but statistical information about connections will still be logged\&.

Levels above 0 will generate larger amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Level 2 will log the entire request and responce, and Level 3 is designed for use only by developers and generates HUGE amounts of log data, some of which is extremely cryptic\&.

Note that this is one of the very few options which cannot be specified in the \fIjhttpd\&.conf\fR file\&.

.TP
\-\-help
\-h
Print a summary of command line options\&.

.TP
\-P <port number>
\fIport number\fR is a TCP port jhttpd should listen on\&. The default value is 80 if uid is 0 and 8008 otherwise\&.

.SH "FILES"

.TP
\fI/etc/mime\&.types\fR
This is the default file loaded to map file extensions to mime information\&.

.TP
\fI/etc/jhttpd/jhttpd\&.conf\fR
This is the default location of the \fBjhttpd\&.conf\fR(5) server configuration file\&.

This file describes all the services the server is to make available to clients\&. See \fBjhttpd\&.conf\fR(5) for more information\&.

.TP
\fI/etc/init.d/jhttpd\fR
This is the default location of the file to start the jhttpd service\&.

.TP
\fI/etc/jhttpd/conf\&.d\fR
This is the default location for extra \fBjhttpd\&.conf\fR(5) server configuration files\&. All files placed in this directory ending with \&.conf will be loaded by the default init\&.d startup file\&.

.SH "VERSION"

.PP
This man page is correct for version 1\&.0\&.0 of the jhttpd server\&.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.PP
Diagnostics issued by the server are logged either to stderr, or if \-\-daemon has been specified (and daemon mode has been started) logged to the /dev/log (aka. syslogd) service\&.

.PP
Each diagnostic starts with a single word, identifying what that diagnostic is for:

.TP
\fICONNECT\fR
This means a connection was established\&.

.TP
\fIFREE\fR
This means a connection was terminated\&.

.TP
\fIREQ\fR
This means a request was processed, this is followed by the operation name (Ie\&. GET, HEAD, TRACE)\&.

.TP
\fIERREQ\fR
This means an "error" request was processed, note that this can mean that the other side did something wrong (Ie\&. a malformed request) or not (Ie\&. a redirect)\&.

.TP
\fIBLOCKED\fR
This means a request was blocked, this can happen at either the connection or the request level\&.

.TP
\fICONF-*\fR
This means an error was encountered when processing the configuration, this can happen at either the connection or the request level\&.

.TP
\fIREADY\fR
This means the server has finished initializing and is now ready to serve requests\&.

.SH "SIGNALS"

.PP
All signals are either ignored, like SIGHUP, or will cause \fBjhttpd\fR to log a message and exit\&.

.PP
The debug log level of \fBjhttpd\fR may be raised or lowered using \fBjcntl\fR(1) program and the "DBG" and "UNDBG" commands\&.

.PP
The \fBjhttpd\fR service may be told to close all listening sockets and exit when it has finished servicing it's current connections using \fBjcntl\fR(1) program and the "CLOSE" command\&. This is also available as service jhttpd softshutdown\&.

.PP
The \fBjhttpd\fR service may be told to close all listening sockets and exit when it has finished servicing it's current connections using \fBjcntl\fR(1) program and the "CLOSE" command\&. This is also available as service jhttpd softshutdown\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP
\fBjhttpd\&.conf\fR(5), \fBjcntl\fR(1), \fBjconf\fR(1), and the Internet RFC's: \fIrfc2616\&.txt\fR, \fIrfc2617\&.txt\fR, \fIrfc1123\&.txt\fR, \fIrfc2068\&.txt\fR\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"

.PP
The jhttpd software is written by James Antill, and is available from http://www\&.and\&.org/jhttpd\&.
