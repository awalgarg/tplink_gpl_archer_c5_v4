2006-02-06: Version 1.0.15 ... Added bytemap functions to parse
faster. Speedup custom formatters, with a hash. Work around hidden
Linux UIO 2GB limit. Work around gcc-4.x symbol aliasing
braindamge. Solaris build fixes. Fix loading zero sized files with
vstr_sc_*_file(), two other minor fixes.

2005-01-09: Version 1.0.14 ... Couple of corner case bug fixes. In
vstr_sc_*file_ no use O_NONBLOCK on open() to stop hangs on FIFOs, also repeat
read() request until all file is read or have error. Encoded more characters in
vstr_conv_encode_uri() by default. HTTPD example is now pretty compliant with
HTTP/1.1, and has more than just better security going for it. Build fixes for
non-Linux platforms.

2004-08-29: Version 1.0.13 ... More testing, now at 100% code coverage.
Some functions were added for working with binary data, using iterators,
doing user friend byte output with large numbers, and working with things
like gmp. Build is now much nicer, with the examples being built by default
compiling on FreeBSD working by default and LFS support being more developer
friendly.

2004-01-25: Version 1.0.12 ... More testing, now at over 99% code coverage.
One largish bug was found, and regression tests added for it. A couple of
smaller bugs were also found and fixed. A couple of new functions for storing
constant data in the configuration, for use in callbacks or whatever. And
a group allocator for Vstr_ref is now used internally for some operations.

2003-12-14: Version 1.0.11 ... Make vstr_export_chr() easier to optimize for
GCC. Custom formatters now accept %d instead of the field width or precision in
the static format checkers compat. (this fixes custom formatters starting with a
%p which have both a field width _and_ a precision). Build fixes for cygwin,
64bit arches and ICC.

2003-09-30: Version 1.0.10 ... More testing, now at over 98% code coverage.
A bunch of new features so that the printf like function can easily emulate
some more common extensions, including configurable grouping per base and the
ability to print numbers in base 2. Added code so that temporary strings can
be created used and destroyed without entering malloc(). Changes to
documentation and examples. Removed C++ inline code, now C++ just calls the
out of line versions.

2003-09-29: Version 1.0.9 ... Slightly more testing, now at over 96% code
coverage. Another set of corner cases got fixed. More documentation, including
a tutorial on custom formatters. Added a bunch of functions to help with
creating custom formatters for number types.

2003-09-22: Version 1.0.8 ... Slightly more testing, now at almost 96% code
coverage. Another set of corner cases got fixed. More documentation, including
a tutorial. Added a simple C to html converter example, re-did parts of the
examples to be simpler (for the tutorial).

2003-08-23: Version 1.0.7 ... Added more tests, now at over 95% code
coverage. Another set of corner cases got fixed. More documentation. Some
portability fixes.

2003-05-31: Version 1.0.6 ... Added a pile of more tests, now at 89% code
coverage. A large amount of corner cases got fixed.

2003-05-07: Version 1.0.5 ... Added speedups for vstr_fmt_add(). Added some
documentation. Added vstr_sc_fmt_add_rep_chr function.

2003-03-15: Version 1.0.4 ... fixed an ABI bug introduced in 1.0.3 ... speed up
export_cstr_ptr() in certain cases ... fixed problem with substituting data of
_ptr and _ref types and having a bad position cache ... added documentation
about the internal design.

2003-03-04: Version 1.0.3 ... a few corner case bugs fixed ... Added a
HAVE_CACHE control for Vstr strings ... fixed the examples to work on 0
length proc files ... added assert calls to inline functions ... added
builtin_constant_p() and speedups related to that.

2003-02-21: Version 1.0.2 ... a couple more functions added to make life
easier for calculating lengths given positions ... build fixes for
FreeBSD ... runtime fixes for using code from C++.

2003-02-12: Version 1.0.1 ... first binary compatible release, more testsuite
code which made a pile of bug fixes ... also a lot of simple functions added
to make life easier.

2003-01-20: Version 1.0.0 ... the first truley stable release has now been
made. ABI is frozen for 1.0.x lifetime ... API will only have things added to
it etc.
