 The library itself claims /^vstr[a-z0-9_]*$/i as a namespace.
 Saying that all types are under...

   Vstr_[a-z0-9]*

...all other global symbols (Ie. functions/variables) are under...

   vstr_[a-z0-9]*

...and all CPP symbols/constants are under...

   VSTR_[A-Z0-9]*

...this is mainly to make it easier to see what you are dealing with.

 All of the namespace where a double _ appears is not supposed to be used
directly by _you_ the user of the library. If these interfaces change and
it isn't visible via. the normal interfaces then the binary/source interface
numbers will _NOT_ be changed on the library.
