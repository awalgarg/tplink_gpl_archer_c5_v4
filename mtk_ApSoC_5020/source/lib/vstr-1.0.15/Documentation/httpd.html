    <h1>HTTPD using Vstr</h1>

<p> You can see the source of the JHTTPD daemon
<a href="examples/ex_httpd.c">here</a>, some writing in general about
HTTP/1.1 after implementing a server is
<a href="http://www.and.org/texts/server-http">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
    Simple. Secure. Unit tests (over 90% coverage).

    Design is a statemachine triggering off IO events, somewhat like thttpd and boa (among others).
     Simple tests with ab show it to be about twice as fast as thttpd-2.20c (note that thttpd doesn't support keep-alive, which gives jhttpd a significant advantage -- mainly due to usage of Vstr).

    Uses the following system utilities:
     poll or epoll, multiplexing
     multiple process support. for MP systems
     sendfile or mmap, for file contents
     LFS
     TCP_CORK
     TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT
     posix_fadvise()
     chroot, privilage de-escalation (can also easily be started as non-root)
     does a bind mount for /dev/log when in a chroot.
     socket filters
     IP binding

    Is HTTP/1.1 conditionally compliant, as far as I know.
    Supports optional HTTP/1.1 features:
     Accept header for Content-Type.
     0.9 HTTP compatability support
     keep-alive, on by default for 1.1 and 1.0
     virtual hosts (via. prefix directories and explicit configuration
                    statements)
     if-modified-since/if-unmodified-since
     byte ranges (single and multipart/byteranges)
       if-range
       multipart/byteranges can also be limited to prevent DOS attacks.
     accept-encoding/content-encoding for gzip/bzip2 (via. pre-generated files)
      Also fully obeys identity
     ETags
     accept-language negotiation to serve multiple languages
     

    Parses /etc/mime.types file
      plus extensions for disallowing certain file types.

    Configuration file parser.
     Also has optional "per request" configuration files (using the same code, 
     and thus layout, as the main configuration files), allowing you to:
      Generate explicit Content-Types.
       Generate negotiated Content-Types for requests with multiple types.
       Eg. http://www.and.org/vstr/examples/httpd.c
         is available as text/plain and text/html
      Generate Content-MD5 data.
      Generate Content-Location data.
      Generate Expires and Cache-Control data.
      Generate all four types of redirect's.
      Generate the usable types of error conditions.
      Change the file object used to serve the data.
      Has a native ACL configuration (can also use Linux socket filters).
      All "configuration parameters" done through policies.
       Change configuration policy based on ip address connections.
       Change configuration policy based on many parameters of the request.
        Automatically generate the "right" Vary header based on which fields
        of the request were tested.

    includes init.d file, and allows "local controller" connections for soft
    restarts, status information etc.

    Converter to make log files that look like apache-httpd combined log files.

    DOES NOT:
      Auto generate directory listings (see ex_dir_list2html in Vstr examples)

      SSI, or other file contents parsing (see ex_ssi in Vstr examples)

      Run programs (doesn't call exec at all, only calls fork() at startup
                    for MP systems).

      Call any i18n/gettext libc functions (will be fixed).

      Parse or honor the Accept-Charset header.

      Full date parser (not a problem, string matches work well).

   NMAP simple service fingerprint(s):
