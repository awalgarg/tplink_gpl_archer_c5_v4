Section: Compile switch constants

Constant: VSTR_COMPILE_ATTRIBUTES

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether gcc type __attribute__() statements are used in
 the public headers headers for the library. If the value is 1 then if they are
 supported by the compiler that built the library they will be used, if the
 value is 0 they won't be used at all.


Constant: VSTR_COMPILE_INCLUDE

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether including <vstr.h> will include all the system
 headers needed for the exported interfaces. If the value is 1 then if they are
 included, if the value is 0 they won't be included.


Constant: VSTR_COMPILE_INLINE

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether inline functions will be used in the public
 headers for the library. If the value is 1 then if they are supported by the
 compiler that built the library they will be used, if the value is 0 they
 won't be used.


Constant: VSTR_COMPILE_MACRO_FUNCTIONS

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether macro functions will be used in the public
 headers for the library. If the value is 1 then they will be used, if the
 value is 0 they won't be used.

 Note:

  This only includes the macro  functions which also have real function
 replacements. For example VSTR_ADD_CSTR_BUF() won't be defined because there
 is a vstr_add_cstr_buf() function, but VSTR_FMT_CB_ARG_PTR() will always be
 defined.


Constant: VSTR_COMPILE_TYPEDEF

 Explanation:

  This switch controls whether typedef will be used for the structs in the
 public headers for the library. If the value is 1 then they will be used,
 if the value is 0 they won't be used at all (and your code will have to use
 struct tags instead -- note all libraries using vstr should compile with
 this option set).


Section: Global constants

Constant: VSTR_MAX_NODE_ALL

 Explanation:

  This is the largest size a node can be, if you pass values greater than this
 to vstr_add_ptr() etc. then multiple nodes will be allocated.


Constant: VSTR_MAX_NODE_BUF

 Explanation:

  This is the largest size a node _BUF type can be, if you pass values greater
 than this to vstr_add_buf() etc. then multiple nodes will be allocated.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_make_spare_nodes() and vstr_free_spare_nodes()

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_NODE_BUF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to vstr_make_space_nodes() specifies nodes of type _BUF,
 which are the only nodes that can be "written" to. These nodes are added into
 a Vstr string by the vstr_add_buf() function and the vstr_add_iovec_buf_*()
 functions.

 Note:

  A call to vstr_sub_buf() with a Vstr string consisting of _BUF nodes means
 that data will be substituted inplace.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_NODE_NON

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to vstr_make_space_nodes() specifies nodes of type _NON,
 which are nodes that contain "nothing". These nodes can be used as placeholders
 for data, and are added into a Vstr string by the vstr_add_non() function.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_NODE_PTR

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to vstr_make_space_nodes() specifies nodes of type _PTR,
 which are nodes that contain a memory pointer to an area of memory.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_NODE_REF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to vstr_make_space_nodes() specifies nodes of type _REF,
 which are nodes that contain a Vstr memory reference.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_add_vstr() and vstr_sub_vstr()

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ADD_DEF
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SUB_DEF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to either vstr_sub_vstr() or vstr_add_vstr() specifies
 that all types of nodes are added as their respective type.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_PTR
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SUB_BUF_PTR

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to either vstr_sub_vstr() or vstr_add_vstr() specifies
 that all nodes of type _BUF are added as type _PTR.

 Note:

  If you add/del/sub data in the original Vstr string then because the added
 data is only pointers to the old data, life may become interesting for you.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ADD_BUF_REF
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SUB_BUF_REF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to either vstr_sub_vstr() or vstr_add_vstr() specifies
 that all nodes of type _BUF are converted to type _REF before being added.


 Note:

  This means that if you do a substitution on the original Vstr string it will
 now be less efficient, as the _REF nodes cannot have data substituted in place.
  The _BUF nodes will not go back to the pool in the Vstr configuration as
 happens if you deleted them.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ADD_ALL_REF
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SUB_ALL_REF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to either vstr_sub_vstr() or vstr_add_vstr() specifies
 that the data should be taken as though vstr_export_ref() was called on the
 original Vstr string.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ADD_ALL_BUF
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SUB_ALL_BUF

 Explanation:

  This type when passed to either vstr_sub_vstr() or vstr_add_vstr() specifies
 that the data should all be added via. vstr_add_buf().


Section: Constants passed to vstr_fmt_add()

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_FMT_END

 Explanation:

  This flag means that there are no more arguments to be expected.

 Note:

  Because you can have multiple arguments associated with one custom "fmt"
 specification this has to be the last argument to every call to
 vstr_fmt_add().
  Just specifying this type means that there are no arguments used, by the
 custom "fmt" specification.

 Explanation:

  This flag means that vstr_add_vfmt() should not expect any arguments passed,
 but should set the value of errno, just before calling the user callback, to
 the value upon entering vstr_add_vfmt().


Section: Constants returned from vstr_iter_fwd_*()


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ITER_DEF

 Explanation:

  This return flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer
 documentation to mean nothing special is meant for this data.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ITER_END

 Explanation:

  This return flag means that the data is at an end.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_ITER_NON

 Explanation:

  This return flag means that the data is actually from within a node of type
 VSTR_TYPE_NODE_NON.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_sc_fmt_cb_beg()

Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is the same as just specifying VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_STR.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_STR

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the object should be treated as a C style string,
 so it is assumed that number orientated flags should be ignored and that
 the length of the object can be arbitrarily truncated.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_ATOM

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the object should be treated as an atomic piece of
 data, so it is assumed that number orientated flags should be ignored and
 that the length of the object can't be truncated.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the object you are printing should be treated as a
 number. For instance setting a precision will truncate the length of the
 object, unless it is a number. Also +/-/<space> leaders and zero padding will
 only be done for numbers.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NEG

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as negative number. This flag has no meaning if
 VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_HEXNUM_H

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as an uppercase hexadecimal (base 16) number. This flag has no meaning
 if VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_HEXNUM_L

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as a lowercase hexadecimal (base 16) number. This flag has no meaning
 if VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_OCTNUM

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as octal (base 8) number. This flag has no meaning if
 VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_BINNUM_H

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as an uppercase base 2 number. This flag has no meaning if
 VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_BINNUM_L

 Explanation:

  This flag indicates that the number object you are printing should be
 treated as a lowercase base 2 number. This flag has no meaning if
 VSTR_FLAG_SC_FMT_CB_BEG_OBJ_NUM is not set.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_conv_unprintable_del() and vstr_conv_unprintable_chr()

Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_NONE

 Explanation:

  This flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer documentation to mean
 no flags are applied to this function.

 Note:

  Because it is sometimes hard are to notice certain characters, they are
 classified as "unprintable" by default, the value
 VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_DEF is a default that is what most people would
 expect to be classified as unprintable.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_NUL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x00 byte, aka. NULL, through as a "printable"
 character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_BEL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x07 byte, aka. terminal bell, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_BS

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x08 byte, aka. backspace, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_HT

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x09 byte, aka. horizontal tab, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_LF

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x0A byte, aka. line feed, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_VT

 Explanation:

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x0D byte, aka. carriage return, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_SP

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x20 byte, aka. space, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_COMMA

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x2C byte, aka. comma, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_DOT

 Explanation:

 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_DEL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0x7F byte, aka. delete, through as a
 "printable" character.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_HSP

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the ASCII 0xA0 byte through as a "printable" character.

 Note:

  The value 0xA0 is 0x20 with the high bit set, and this character it often
 printed as space when in an ASCII like encoding.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_ALLOW_HIGH

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the all ASCII bytes greater than or equal to 0xA1 through as
 "printable" characters.

 Note:

  This includes all the extra characters like not, degree, copyright and micro
 when in an ASCII like encoding.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_CONV_UNPRINTABLE_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is the same as using the flags for space, comma, dot and underbar.
 Using just this flag is probably what you'd expect an "unprintable" function
 to do.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_parse_num() etc.

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_NONE

 Explanation:

  This error code has the value 0, and means that no error occurred parsing the
 number from the Vstr string.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_ONLY_S

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the Vstr string consisted only of spaces.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_ONLY_SPM

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the Vstr string consisted only spaces, and a plus
 or minus sign.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_ONLY_SPMX

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the Vstr string consisted only spaces, a plus
 or minus sign and a "0x" base 16 prefix.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_OOB

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the Vstr string had characters in it that where
 out of bounds from the working set.

 Note:

  This out of bounds includes the Vstr string "++" as well as "4A", when
 parsing in a base less than 11.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_OVERFLOW

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the number parsed from the Vstr string would
 overflow the type it is being parsed into, this is only returned when the
 VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_OVERFLOW flag was passed to the parse function.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_NEGATIVE

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the number parsed from the Vstr string starts
 with a '-' (Hyphen) character when it is supposed to be an unsigned type.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_BEG_ZERO

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the number parsed from the Vstr string starts
 with a '0' (Digit Zero) character, when the VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_NO_BEG_ZERO
 flag was passed to the parse function.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer documentation to mean
 no flags are applied to this function.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_LOCAL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing from ASCII numbers into "local" numbers
 (whatever is generated by '0 .. '9' by the host compiler). This can be ignored
 by anyone not using an EBCDIC character set, or something equally weird.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_SEP

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the parsing of the '_' (Low Line) separator character
 between the digits of the number, so "1234" and "1_234" would both parse the
 same.

 Note:

  The separator is only allowed within the digits of the number, so " _+_1234"
 would fail as would "_1234".


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_OVERFLOW

 Explanation:

  This flag turns on the overflow checking, in other words without it
 VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_NUM_ERR_OVERFLOW will never be returned as an error code.

 Note:

  The return value with this set is the highest number that can be parsed from
 the beginning of the Vstr string, while the value without this flag would be
 the parsed number modulo the highest number of the type.
  For example given a type that had a maximum of 10, then parsing "64" would
 give you 6 with the flag, and 4 without.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_SPACE

 Explanation:

  This flag allows one or more ' ' (Space) characters before the number or
 number prefix (Plus Sign, Hyphen).


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_NO_BEG_ZERO

 Explanation:

  This flag disallows one or more '0' (Digit Zero) characters before the number.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_NO_BEG_PM

 Explanation:

  This flag disallows a plus or a minus character before the number.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_NUM_NO_NEGATIVE

 Explanation:

  This flag disallows negative values.

 Note:

  While this flag can be passed to vstr_parse_int() etc. it is most useful when
 passed to the generic function vstr_parse_num().


Section: Constants passed to vstr_parse_ipv4()

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_NONE

 Explanation:

  This error code has the value 0, and means that no error occurred parsing the
 ipv4 address from the Vstr string.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_IPV4_OOB

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the numbers for the ipv4 address in the
 Vstr string where out of bounds.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_IPV4_FULL

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the ipv4 address wasn't full (Ie. 127/8 is a non
 full ipv4 address with CIDR mask).


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_ONLY

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the ipv4 address, and option mask, wasn't the only
 thing in the Vstr string.

 Note:

  When this error code is returned, the ip address is still parsed out and as
 usable as if no error had occurred.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_CIDR_OOB

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the numbers for the ipv4 CIDR mask in the
 Vstr string where out of bounds.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_CIDR_FULL

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the numbers for the ipv4 netmask in the
 Vstr string where out of bounds.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV4_ERR_NETMASK_FULL

 Explanation:

 127.0.0.1/255.0 is an ipv4 address with a non full ipv4 netmask).


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer documentation to mean
 no flags are applied to this function.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_LOCAL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing from ASCII numbers into "local" numbers
 (whatever is generated by '0 .. '9' by the host compiler). This can be ignored
 by anyone not using an EBCDIC character set, or something equally weird.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_ZEROS

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the use of leading zeros in the ipv4 address and masks.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_FULL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if a
 non full ipv4 address is given (Ie. 127/8 is a non full ipv4 with a CIDR mask).
 If this flag isn't given the missing numbers are assumed to be zero.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_CIDR

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the parsing out of a CIDR mask, if one is present.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_CIDR_FULL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if a
 non full ipv4 CIDR mask is given (Ie. 127.0.0.1/ is an ipv4 with a non full
 ipv4 CIDR mask). If this flag isn't given the missing CIDR mask is assumed to
 be 32.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_NETMASK

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the parsing out of a ipv4 netmask, if one is present.

 Note:

  If both this and the VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_CIDR flag is given, then either
 masking interface will be parsed out (it will try a CIDR mask first and if
 that filas, fall back to a netmask prefix).


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_NETMASK_FULL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if a
 non full ipv4 NETMASK mask is given (Ie. 127.0.0.1/255.0 is an ipv4 with a non
 full ipv4 netmask). If this flag isn't given the missing numbers are assumed to
 be zero.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV4_ONLY

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if the
 entire string isn't used to contain the ipv4 and option mask.

 Note:

  When this error code is returned, the ip address is still parsed out and as
 usable as if no error had occurred.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_parse_ipv6()

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV6_ERR_NONE

 full ipv6 address with CIDR mask).


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV6_ERR_ONLY

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the ipv6 address, and option mask, wasn't the only
 thing in the Vstr string.

 Note:

  When this error code is returned, the ip address is still parsed out and as
 usable as if no error had occurred.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV6_ERR_CIDR_OOB

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the numbers for the ipv6 CIDR mask in the
 Vstr string where out of bounds.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV6_ERR_CIDR_FULL

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the ipv6 CIDR mask wasn't full (Ie. F::1/ is
 an ipv6 address with a non full ipv6 CIDR mask).


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_PARSE_IPV6_ERR_IPV6_NULL

 Explanation:

  This error code means that there is more than one "NULL" point in the
 ipv6 address, for example "F::E::1" has two NULL points and is impossible
 to parse.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV6_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer documentation to mean
 no flags are applied to this function.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV6_LOCAL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing from ASCII numbers into "local" numbers
 (whatever is generated by '0 .. '9' by the host compiler). This can be ignored
 by anyone not using an EBCDIC character set, or something equally weird.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV6_CIDR

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the parsing out of a CIDR mask, if one is present.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV6_CIDR_FULL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if a
 non full ipv6 CIDR mask is given (Ie. ::1/ is an ipv6 with a non full
 ipv6 CIDR mask). If this flag isn't given the missing CIDR mask is assumed to
 be 32.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_PARSE_IPV6_ONLY

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the parsing so that the function will return an error if the
 entire string isn't used to contain the ipv6 and option mask.

 Note:

  When this error code is returned, the ip address is still parsed out and as
 usable as if no error had occurred.


Section: Constants used with the custom output formatter for ipv6 addresses

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_FMT_CB_IPV6_ALIGNED

 Explanation:

  This flag outputs the ipv6 address as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal values.
 For example "FFFF:0EEE:00DD:000C:0000:0000:0001:0002" would be an ipv6 address
 output in aligned mode.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_FMT_CB_IPV6_COMPACT

 Explanation:

  This flag outputs the ipv6 address in as small a representation as possible,
 for example "FFFF:EEE:DD:C::1:2" would be an ipv6 address
 output in compact mode.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_FMT_CB_IPV6_STD

 Explanation:

  This flag outputs the ipv6 address as 8 groups of hexadecimal numbers between
 0 and FFFF, this is the format mostly used in standards. documents,
 for example "FFFF:EEE:DD:C:0:0:1:2" would be an ipv6 address
 output in compact mode.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_FMT_CB_IPV6_IPV4_ALIGNED

 Explanation:

  This flag outputs the ipv6 address in the same way as
 VSTR_TYPE_SC_FMT_CB_IPV6_ALIGNED, except that the last 2 groups of hexadecimal
 values (the last 4 octets) are replaced with an ipv4 address.

Section: Constants passed to vstr_split_buf(), vstr_split_cstr_buf(), VSTR_SPLIT_CSTR_BUF(), vstr_split_chrs(), vstr_split_cstr_chrs() and VSTR_SPLIT_CSTR_CHRS()

Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_DEF

 Explanation:

  This flag is 0, and is generally only used as programmer documentation to mean
 no flags are applied to this function.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_BEG_NULL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the split functions to add sections at the beginning of the
 input that have a null string before the match. For example the input
 "::abcd:..." split on ":" would have 2 sections at positions 1 and 2
 of length 0, without this flag the first section would be at position 3 with
 length 4.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_MID_NULL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the split functions to add sections in the middle of the
 input that have a null string between 2 matches. For example the input
 "a::abcd:..." split on ":" would have the second section at position 3
 of length 0, without this flag the second section would be at position 4 of
 length 4.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_END_NULL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the split functions to add sections at the end of the
 input that have a null string after a match. For example the input
 "a::" split on ":" would have the second section at position 3
 of length 0, without this flag there would only be one section added.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_POST_NULL

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the split functions to add a final post section of the
 input that ends with a match. For example the input "a:" split on ":" would
 have the second section at position 3 (outside the range of the input)
 of length 0, without this flag there would only be one section added.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_NO_RET

 Explanation:

  This flag allows the split functions to return 1, when the Vstr sections
 doesn't have any more room. Without the flag the split functions would
 calculate the number of splits that would have been added if there was room
 in the Vstr sections.


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SPLIT_REMAIN

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the split functions, when used with a limit, so that the
 last section added is for the remainder of the input.

 backward (from the end to the beginning).


Constant: VSTR_FLAG_SECTS_FOREACH_ALLOW_NULL

 Explanation:

  This flag changes the foreach function so that it calls the foreach callback
 on sections of null length (a non zero position with a zero length).


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SECTS_FOREACH_DEF

 Explanation:

  This return value is 0, and is generally only used as programmer
 documentation to mean nothing special should happen on return from the
 callback.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SECTS_FOREACH_DEL

 Explanation:

  This return value tells the foreach function to delete the current section
 before the next callback is called.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SECTS_FOREACH_RET

 Explanation:

  This return value tells the foreach function to return immediately (it does
 the same thing as a break statement in a C for loop.


Section: Constants used with the callback from vstr_cache_add_cb()

 Explanation:

  This type means that a delete operation has just happened on the Vstr string,
 the position and length arguments are as taken from the vstr_del() function.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CACHE_SUB

 Explanation:

  This type means that a substitute operation has just happened on the
 Vstr string, the position and length arguments are as taken from one of the
 vstr_sub_* functions.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CACHE_FREE

 Explanation:

  This type means that the data in the cache needs to be free()'d, the callback
 should always return NULL when this type is passed in.
  The position and length arguments are undefined.

  Even though this is an error, the mapping has already occurred and was
 successful.
  If another error occurred (Eg. fstat()/mmap()), then any errors from close()
 will be hidden.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_MMAP_FD_ERR_MEM
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_MMAP_FILE_ERR_MEM

 Explanation:

  This error code means that memory could not be allocated.

 Note:

  To help the programer unify error paths base->conf->malloc_bad is set to
 TRUE, and errno is set to ENOMEM.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_MMAP_FD_ERR_TOO_LARGE
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_MMAP_FILE_ERR_TOO_LARGE

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the memory mapping was too big to fit in the
 Vstr string (with LFS extensions files are 63 bits, while on a 32 bit
 computer memory space is still only 32 bits so this isn't a corner case).

 Note:

  To help the programer unify error paths errno is set to EFBIG.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_sc_read_iov_fd(), vstr_sc_read_len_fd(), vstr_sc_read_iov_file() and vstr_sc_read_len_file()

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the call to readv() returned -1, errno is set.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_READ_FILE_ERR_CLOSE_ERRNO

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the call to close() returned -1, errno is set.

 Note:

  Even though this is an error, the readv() has already occurred and was
 successful.
  If another error occurred (Eg. fstat()/readv()), then any errors from close()
 will be hidden.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_READ_FD_ERR_EOF
Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_READ_FILE_ERR_EOF

 Explanation:

  This error code means that the call to readv() returned 0.

 Note:

  If you pass 0 as the length to the read_*_file functions, you can still get
 the _EOF error if the file is truncated while it is being read.
  To help the programer unify error paths errno is set to ENOSPC.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_SC_READ_FD_ERR_MEM

 Note:

  This will only return successfully if either the Vstr string is empty, or
 the Vstr configurations have the same value for the _NUM_BUF_SZ attribute and
 the new configuration has the same caches registered. See vstr_swap_cache()
 for a function that tries to do what you want.
  If the Vstr configuration (Parameter[1]) is NULL, then the default
 Vstr configuration will be used.

 Type[1]: unsigned int *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the size of the allocated portion of a _BUF type node.

 Note:

  The default value of this attribute is currently 48, the reason for this is
 that 8 bytes are used for generic node storage and 8 more bytes are overhead
 used as in glibc's malloc() implementation. This means that 64 bytes are
 allocated for each node of data. Looking at the data given in the size_cmp 
 spreadsheet and the ex_perf_nodesize example my guess is that node sizes above
 512 probably gain very little, while consumiung more space.

Constant: VSTR_CNTL_CONF_SET_LOC_REF_THOU_GRP

 Parameter[1]: Number base of locale information
 Type[1]: unsigned int

 Parameter[2]: Vstr memory reference to thousands grouping C string
 Type[2]: struct Vstr_ref *

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value of the thousands grouping LC_NUMERIC locale
 variable.

 Note:

  The library takes a reference to the memory reference provided, so if you
 are finished with it you need to remove your reference.


Constant: VSTR_CNTL_CONF_GET_LOC_REF_NULL_PTR

 Parameter[1]: Returns Vstr memory reference to locale NULL pointer C string
 Type[1]: struct Vstr_ref **

 Parameter[2]: Returns length of Vstr memory reference
 Type[2]: size_t *

 Explanation:

  This option will get the value of the locale NULL pointer
 variable. This is what is printed when you pass NULL to "%s".


Constant: VSTR_CNTL_CONF_SET_LOC_REF_NULL_PTR

 Parameter[1]: Vstr memory reference to numeric locale NULL pointer C string
 Type[1]: struct Vstr_ref *

 Parameter[2]: Length of Vstr memory reference
 Type[2]: size_t

 Explanation:

  This option will set the value of the locale NULL pointer
 variable. This is what is printed when you pass NULL to "%s".

 Note:

  The library takes a reference to the memory reference provided, so if you
 are finished with it you need to remove your reference.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_cntl_opt()

Constant: VSTR_CNTL_OPT_GET_CONF

 Parameter[1]: Returns Vstr configuration
 Type[1]: struct Vstr_conf **

 Explanation:

  This option will get the default Vstr configuration.

 Note:

  This adds a reference to the configuration, so when you are finished with it
 you'll have to call vstr_freee_conf() on it.


Constant: VSTR_CNTL_OPT_SET_CONF

 Parameter[1]: Vstr configuration
 Type[1]: struct Vstr_conf *

 Explanation:

  This option will set the default Vstr configuration.

 Note:

  This is one of the few functions that take a configuration, but cannot take a
 NULL pointer instead.


Section: Constants passed to vstr_cntl_conf(..., VSTR_CNTL_CONF_SET_TYPE_GRPALLOC_CACHE

Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CNTL_CONF_GRPALLOC_NONE

 Explanation:

  This type means that there is a group allocation configuration to not
 allocating a cache.

 Note:

  This is type will mean that VSTR_CNTL_CONF_GET_FLAG_ALLOC_CACHE is FALSE.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CNTL_CONF_GRPALLOC_POS

 Explanation:

  This type means that there is a group allocation configuration to allocating
 a cache and allocating room to store a position cache.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CNTL_CONF_GRPALLOC_IOVEC

 Explanation:

  This type means that there is a group allocation configuration to allocating
 a cache and allocating room to store a position cache and an iovec cache.

 Note:

  The only way to guarantee that you have an iovec available immediately after
 calling vstr_make_base() is to have at least this group allocation
 configuration.


Constant: VSTR_TYPE_CNTL_CONF_GRPALLOC_CSTR

 Explanation:

  This type means that there is a group allocation configuration to allocating
 a cache and allocating room to store a position cache, an iovec cache and a
 cstr cache holder.
