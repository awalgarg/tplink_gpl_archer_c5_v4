    <h1>Doing IO with request and truncate</h1>

<p> While some string APIs that use a single block of memory for each string
don't have a specific function to read X bytes from this
file/socket onto the end of the string, they do have both a request space and
a truncate space function. This makes it possible to do zero copy, possibly
non-blocking, read IO onto the end of your string.
<p> The idea is that, assuming you have a string <b>s1</b>,
a file descriptor <b>fd</b>, and
a number of bytes to read <b>num</b>. You can create a function which does...
<pre>
len = API_len(s1);

API_request(s1, num);

bytes = read(fd, API_buf(s1) + len, num);
if (bytes == -1)
{
  /* deal with the error */ ;
  bytes = 0;
}

API_truncate(s1, len + bytes);
</pre>
...and it can be called for non-blocking IO, and be fairly efficient. However
note that the string is still going to grow inefficently (possibly
copying data a lot) as you request space ... and any space allocated in the
string for IO is lost until the string is free'd. This may or may not be a
problem, depending.
