Overview
    The USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system
    over IP network. To share USB devices between computers with their
    full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP packets
    and transmits them between computers. Original USB device drivers and
    applications can be also used for remote USB devices without any
    modification of them.  A computer can use remote USB devices as if
    they were directly attached; for example, we can ...

        - USB storage devices: fdisk, mkfs, mount/umount, file operations,
          play a DVD movie and record a DVD-R media.  

        - USB keyboards and USB mice: use with linux console and X Window
          System.  

        - USB webcams and USB speakers: view webcam, capture image data and
          play some music.

        - USB printers, USB scanners, USB serial converters and USB Ethernet
          interfaces: ok, use fine. 

    On one host, the VHCI (Virtual Host Controller Interface) driver
    is implemented as a USB host controller driver. The VHCI driver
    emulates a real USB host controller interface for virtual
    attachment/detachment, enumeration and initialization of remote USB
    devices. It encapsulates USB request blocks and then transmits USB/IP
    packets to a remote host. On the other host, the Stub driver is
    implemented as a USB per-device driver. The Stub driver decapsulates
    USB/IP packets into USB requests and then submit them to real USB
    devices. 

    For more information, please see http://usbip.sourceforge.net/ .
    The detail is described in an academic paper.


Compile & Install
    USB/IP needs both kernel drivers and userland utilities.

    The kernel modules are in the drivers/ subdirectory.
    See drivers/README for details.

    The userspace applications are in the src/ subdirectory.
    See src/README for details


Usages
    - Import devices from a server host.
      Normal operation. e.g., device servers.
      Read src/README for details.

    - Export devices automatically when plugged.
      e.g., thin client systems and remote desktop programs.
      Read src/README.usbaid for details.
      This feature is added by Robert. Thanks.
